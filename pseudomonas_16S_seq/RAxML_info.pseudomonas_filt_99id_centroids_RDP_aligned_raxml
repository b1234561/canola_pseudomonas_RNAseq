IMPORTANT WARNING: Sequences Pseudomonas_aeruginosa_2980 and Pseudomonas_tropicalis_2 are exactly identical


IMPORTANT WARNING: Sequences Pseudomonas_corrugata_2 and Pseudomonas_tolaasii_3 are exactly identical

IMPORTANT WARNING
Found 2 sequences that are exactly identical to other sequences in the alignment.
Normally they should be excluded from the analysis.

Just in case you might need it, an alignment file with 
sequence duplicates removed is printed to file pseudomonas_filt_99id_centroids_RDP_aligned_no-period.afa.reduced
